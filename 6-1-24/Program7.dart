class Point {
  int x;
  int y;
}

void main() {
  Point obj = Point();
}

//here we have created a class Point and defined 2 variables int x and x.
//but we are getting a error because we havent initialized the values and also did not applied null safety to the variables.
//Thats why its showing error
